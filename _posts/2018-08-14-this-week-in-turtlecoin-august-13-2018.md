## _We’ve got your Krang automation updates, we’ve got your Twitch tipping integration, we’ve got your algo updates, we’ve got your humble Masari devs, we’ve got it all today and today only, folks! No money down, no interest, any algorithm, you got a pen you drive it off the lot, in this late edition of the TRTL Roundup!_

**Also, what do you think of the new blog?**

# Developer Community Updates

**Dawn of the Krang-**_I have settled into my new job and now have time to work on Krang (The Testnet Automation Suite from Dimension-X). The purpose of Krang is to allow the dev team to spin up and tear down environments quicker than Shredder goes through foot soldiers. See repo readme and issues for more details._
_I have setup a repo in my lab that_
_1\. Uses Terraform to deploy dropets_
_2\. Generates a Dynamic Ansible Inventory (created from the terraform state file)_
_3\. Leverages Ansible to deploy config management and docker/docker-compose applications to the freshly deployed servers._
_4\. Remotely summons the techno-drome to Earth (Classified — DM for more info)_
_This is still the beginning of the project and I am working with SoreGums to put it all together. I will be committing my work over the next week and getting a PR in, although there is a lot more to do. Shout out to me if you have bash scripting or python skills (or you want to learn) as I will be building a wrapper script in the near future and it’s been while since i played with my python (it’s pretty friendly if you want to learn code), unless there’s a better way @iburnmycd_

_. (Then off for two weeks in Japan, shout out if you live in Japan). Have a great week Turtles-_ **_Slash-atello_**

**TwitchTurtle-**_Twitch Turtle is an Instant, Practically feeless, way to Donate. Setup is fast, and only takes thirty seconds! Integrates seamlessly with StreamLabs so you wont miss a beat. TwitchTurtle uses the latest v0.7.0 build of Turtlecoin_ **_\-Watter_**

**Gladiator Bot — Turtacus —** _As most people know, Turtacus allows players to conduct player versus player battles with each other in the colosseum. Recently, battles have come to a stand still and I’d like to figure out why. What can be done to get people using Turtacus again? For two weeks running, third place on the weekly tournament has ended with 3 wins taking the prize. Let me remind everyone that every Sunday the leaderboard prizes are paid out at:_
**_1st place — 10,000trtl_** **_2nd place — 6,500trtl_** **_3rd place — 3,500trtl_**

Masari Helps Turtle! — Earlier this week, I was referred to Masari dev Gnock’s cool client-side web wallet by F0sching in the chat. I was very impressed with what I saw when I tried out MasariWallet.com and was very happy to see Gnock was very friendly and happy to collaborate. He’s got a cool web wallet that keeps all of the private stuff happening on the user side rather tha on the web server, which is a big plus-one for user security. Over the coming weeks we will be updating you guys on our porting of the Masari Web Wallet for TurtleCoin users, as well as helping Gnock knock out some of the items on the todo list! Stay tuned, and please feel free to pitch in and lend a hand to make this web wallet even more awesome! -Rock

Join us (Mine2Gether) for our next Blockchain Bingo, Tuesday August 14 @ 5 PM GMT. Everyone is welcome! 50k TRTL prizes and more! It is FREE to play! Hope to see you There!  
Join the #bingo channel in the Mine2Gether discord <https://discord.gg/yy5rJwX>  
Blockchain bingo is for community fun, open to everyone, and completely free to play. It is a variation and similar to traditional bingo. Each player’s card contains 24 unique numbers between 0 and 49, in 5 rows of 5 numbers, and the centre square is free.  
Numbers are drawn based on the block heights of matured blocks (not ‘pending’) on our Turtle pool (orphan blocks do not count). <https://trtl.mine2gether.com/#bingo> The last two digits of each matured block height are the number, for example block height 600015 will be number 15.  
Numbers above 50 will start at 0 again, for example block height 600050 would be the number 0, and height 600065 would be 15, and so on.. These numbers are used to fill the corresponding numbers on each players card. This continues until a player fills their card in the pattern that was designated at the beginning of the game.  
When a player matches the pattern and calls ‘!bingo bingo’ they win the game, and the game is over.

# Fork Watch! (new)

Ok! So with all the new networks forking TurtleCoin using our [Quick And Easy Forking Guide,](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/wiki/Forking-TurtleCoin) I thought it would be a great thing to do to start all forks off on the right foot and list them here, and for the ones who have cool new ideas, we can spice it up with a feature article showing off your changes. **Let me know what you guys think; does this help a network start off right or will this be a comedy column of this week’s hottest shitcoins?**
