We needed a good celebration image this week for our 6 month bday party, so I dug up this wallpaper by community member Crisis Rogue

Fexra’s TurtleWallet

**TurtleWallet —** _“This week has been very busy! New features, many improvements, and stability and daemon health checks! Insight page has gotten a major overhaul; conversion works across the wallet now and also calculates the historical conversion; and the activity / notification system is coming along nicely. I hope to have everything fully working next week for another test run :)”_**— fexra**

**Nest —** _“You might have experienced issues with the Nest wallet this week. They were due to the way the core client deals with certain large blocks. Issues have been fixed and new versions of the core client and of Nest are being tested. Nest v0.23 will be released in a day or two and will be announced on Reddit and Discord.”_ **_—_ Jon-Nest**

**TRTL Pixels —** _“\_What happens when you give the community the ability to draw something one pixel at a time? Well… Let’s see! I started a new project this week as a bit of a social experiment, inspired by Reddit’s r/Place, and the Million Dollar Homepage. What is it? It’s a new webpage that lets folks “purchase” pixels on an image for 1 TRTL each. Purchasing a pixel let’s you set that pixel to a color of your choice, until it’s purchased again by someone else. At the moment, I have the back end coded up, which works by listening for transactions of at least 1 TRTL, then uses a generated payment ID to know which pixel was bought and what color it should be. It then draws that pixel onto an image that will be viewable on a webpage. I’m excited to see just what the TRTL Network community draws, one pixel at a time. The front end webpage is coming soon, I’ll make it known when it’s public so you can all get drawing!_”\_ **— Canti**

**TrtlBotSharp —** _“I’ve been rewriting Madk’s tip bot from the ground up to add everything he wanted added, and I also made it easier to add new features in the future. The rewrite is done, and now I am running through and testing every little thing to make sure it’s perfect before we launch it. And fear not, your current tip balances will still be applicable to the new bot!”_**— Canti**

**turtlenode.io —** _“This week I’ve been working on a few things for core TurtleCoin code as well as ancillary projects. My current task is importing the current blockchain information into SQLite to provide a faster backend for the blockchain explorer(s). Once I know the code is solid to do so, I’ll publish the code on github as usual but the first test deployments will be on the TurtleNode.io backends at api.turtlenode.io where the turtlecoin-api-proxy lives that will intercept blockexplorer requests and serve them out of SQLite. In addition to making block explorers faster, this will also enable us to run analytical queries against the blockchain to gain additional insight into average block times, block & transaction sizes, average mixin amounts, and wide variety of additional data points.”_ **— iburnmycd**

**Gladiator Bot —**_“Gladiator Bot is now in full swing! His leveling system is complete and running although this is still only for bragging rights! However, more importantly, tips are now awarded for every win in the arena! The latest update brought the leaderboard, by typing \*leader you are given the top 10 Gladiators. This has now been announced into a weekly competition. Every Sunday at a random time (to prevent spam fights last minute) the scoreboard will be reset and the person in first place will be awarded 10,000TRTL. Thank you all for your continued support and suggestions.”_ **— Rynem**

**TurtleCoin snail racing — _“_**_TurtleCoin’s very own aquatic snail races will be up and running within the next month. The pool installation began today, after a nice shady spot of land in the backyard had been cleared to make way for our community’s racetrack that doubles as a pond. This pool is going to be the comfy home to many snails, and even… a couple turtles :)”_ **_—_ Rogerrobers**
