## Developer Updates

_This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community._ **_To submit your post, click this link_** <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTs4nDSKai2fPpCnuT0WXzutCuJQk7nFlFqYCgmBlz4DEM7Q/viewform>

## Karai docs

This week I whipped up a site to begin documenting the emerging karai API methods. I’m using swagger for the documentation, which has a pretty handy feature to try out the API right from your web browser.

This will help developers get started building applications using karai. I believe Extra’s block explorer will be using it shortly to supply a health check for coordinators registered in karai pointers.

Right now, the repo is just on my GitHub, but I’ll move it to the TurtleCoin GitHub when I’ve cleaned the code up a little bit.”

**TRTLNIC**

Now that we’ve had a steady run of OpenNIC Tier-2 servers running for well over 6 months, it’s time to put on our big boy pants and actually apply to OpenNIC to accept .trtl domains everywhere. To do so though, we need to graduate from the github based DNS management to something more… automated.

I’ve been working the last few days to continue work I was doing on building a nifty REST API that can be used to register, manage, and perform basic functions with .trtl domains. Think of it like… like… your favorite unnamed registrars. This will make maintaining the system of .trtl domains a lot easier, have built in payment support using TurtlePay, live updates, basic managed DNS for the domains, and a few other cool features I’m baking in. No, I haven’t published any of the code yet, but I’m working to assemble it as quickly as possible. Most of the difficult stuff is done so at this point, there’s very little to do except put together the actual web interface that talks to the API. Hopefully I’ll have more news to post on this in the next few days/weeks.
