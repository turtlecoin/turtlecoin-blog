We know the info on there is not all filled in yet, and we’re working on getting it fixed, so in the mean time please send CMC a thank you tweet, or thank you FB post to express your gratitude that they finally listed us, because truthfully we really did not meet the requirements yet to be listed. This just shows how powerful the community can be!
