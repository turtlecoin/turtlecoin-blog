This Christmas we received the blessing of the community’s progress and our mutual friendship with other networks. TurtleCoin users are quickly becoming the most helpful crew in the industry, and that’s a hat we are happy to wear any time :D

Here’s to another great year, and a good time this New Year for all of our new friends who’ve just joined us!

# Developer Updates

![Image result for turtlecoin asic](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/0*CeM-wa5u8MuWkzIS.jpg)

**Core Update at block 1,200,000 !! Miners! Service Operators! Users! This is your update! Tell a friend!**

**What is a fork? ->** [**Click here to see our article about updates like these and what they mean for you!**](https://blog.turtlecoin.lol/archives/what-the-fork/)

**1,200,000** — This update is a big one, and unlike our normal fork upgrade schedule, this one packs a little bit more of a punch than others in the sense that we have a new hashing algo variant we’ve been working on called CN Turtle. This new algo affects miners two different ways, GPU miners will see about a 4x increase in power, and CPU miners will see about a 6x increase in power. This just means more heat for most of you but for us it means another upgrade without ASIC, and for the first time it means TurtleCoin is branching out from just using whatever Monero and Aeon use. We’re doubling down on our commitment against Nicehash and ASIC, and have already started research on the next PoW change for when that time comes. Everyone probably also wondering, but if you’re on XMR Stak or XMRig, you’re fine, with more compatibility for others coming soon. **— TRTL Core Team**

This wall of text means one thing- We’ve got you covered. This is our commitment to a 2019 without ASIC.

**solo miner improvements** — If you’ve ever used the solo miner, you might know it’s a little ‘meh’. You need to know all the arguments to start the miner with, it doesn’t even output barely anything on the default log level, and the output is pretty verbose. One thing you might not be aware of is it actually by default only scans for a new block template every 30 seconds. So, a lot of the time you might be mining on an old block template when the daemon already has a newer template. This fixes that issue, so there should be a lot less orphans. Annoyingly, the windows network stack seems to hold open the closed connections for some time, so polling for a new template every second can end up exhausting the available sockets. I’m working on a fix for this by reusing the same connection. I know most people don’t use the solo miner, but this should help out projects which fork TurtleCoin and don’t have any pools up yet. **— zpalm**

What is special or new about your network?

The DeroGold Association is the future of crypto today and we welcome you aboard. An open source project since block number 1, DeroGold plans to be one of the most illustrious cryptocurrencies ever. Forking our coin from TurtleCoin and using their new CN-TURTLE hashing algorithm will be instrumental in helping us to achieve this goal.

Some specs of DeroGold include 100 trillion max supply, only 2 decimals, 10 second blocks, cutting-edge lite-blocks, and a wallet prefix of dg. It has been said to be very reminiscent of the early TurtleCoin days, since we have a low nethash and large block rewards with a lot of questions about our huuuuge supply.

Special thanks to RockSteady, Zpalmtree, ExtraHash, and Bearybullish for their contributions toward the making of this cryptocurrency, I appreciate y’alls help.

Good news everyone! If you’re mining TurtleCoin with us at Cryptonote.Social, you’re now also (solo) mining Aeon through the wonders of “merged mining”. For now if you’re lucky enough to mine an Aeon block, you get to collect the full reward. Make sure you specify an e-mail address in your miner config so you’ll be notified of any Aeon blocks you mine.
