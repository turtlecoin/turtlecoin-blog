# Featured Forks

_This is a little section for people who’ve_ [_used our forking guide_](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/wiki/Forking-Turtlecoin) _to make their own network based on TurtleCoin. Check them out and show them some love!_

_Petcoin is a private, secure and untraceable cryptocurrency. It is completely managed, used and mined by you and does not depend on banks or other external entities. Petcoin was created by a group of friends who started to wonder what they could do to help the growing number of animals in need in their country. The animal well-being laws in Portugal are limited and not very effective, so animal shelters and organizations take care of these animals. Most of these organizations don’t have any help other than from volunteers and struggle to take care of so many animals. Petcoin was born, using the blockchain technology, to help this cause. Premined at 12%, which will be delivered to animal organizations (10%) and used to keep the project going on (2%), we aim to be a voice for the voiceless._ **— Javalopes**

- **The cryptonote.social TurtleCoin pool (**<https://cryptonote.social/trtl>**) now uses a unique “predictable solo mining” payment scheme.** The goal of a predictable solo mining pool is to provide an entire block’s reward to a miner as soon as it computes a number of hashes equal to network difficulty. Of course it’s impossible to provide any such guarantee given that mining is a random process: for pure solo mining the network difficulty reflects only the average number of hashes you might have to perform, and the actual number can be 2x, 3x, 4x or even more, making far too risky for most. The good news is that through leveraging the mining power of multiple miners, we can come pretty close to this ideal of awarding 1 full block’s reward when number of hashes equals difficulty. We believe our scheme provides the best dynamics for consistent and well behaved miners, especially for lower difficulty coins like TRTL. Come by and give it a try! <https://cryptonote.social/trtl>
- Hello, I would like to invite everyone to our mining pool! <http://turtleminers.club/> **Turtle Miners Club is a premier mining pool. Speaking of blocks, we just reached 300 blocks!** Come join the club as we head towards 500 blocks.
- Greetings, ye dwarvish miners, It pleaseth me to announce that following a disastrous Ceph upgrade (http://lists.ceph.com/pipermail/ceph-users-ceph.com/2018-July/028153.html), **Funky Penguin’s NZ TRTL Mining Pool has been fully recovered for a week**, **and is now humming along, at 70–80KH/s, with blocks discovered roughly every hour,** entirely due to our homespun charm and rugged handsomeness, and having nothing to do with math, statistics, or related mumbo-jumbo. Most of our hash is currently from the distant land of The United States of Mordor, so feel not left out if ye have not hairy hobbity feet, and come visit at <https://trtl.heigh-ho.funkypenguin.co.nz/>
- (Update: By the time this message reaches you, I’ll have refreshed the pool UI to support email/telegram notifications (srsly, these are nifty little dopamine hits), mine-to-exchange, as well as more detailed stats and extra geek sexiness)
