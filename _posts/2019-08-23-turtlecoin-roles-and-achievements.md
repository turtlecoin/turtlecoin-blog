## Colored chat names, so hot right now

You may have noticed in our weekly roundups that we have a new section for recognizing those who’ve gained new roles in the past week. We get asked a lot about the colored names and ‘roles’ in our Discord chat, and whether people just want the colored name or actively want to contribute to the community, we’re always glad to see someone wanting to involve themselves with TurtleCoin.

This article will be an explainer for each role and what it means to us, and the way to gain them. If you have questions,[ just ask us!](http://chat.turtlecoin.lol/)

Let’s start at the top of the list, and work our way down, from what an admin sees when they log in to TRTL discord.

Green names, some say they aren’t even real people

Green names are Ninja, these are founders of TurtleCoin. This is a closed role, there is no way to earn it, it doesn’t even have any extra privileges other than having a green name. There are a few people with a green name, however this is the most chat-inactive role group on the server.

The first troop of goons to step foot off the Mayflower

Footclan is the role that was created when we were just a few weeks old. TurtleCoin started out with a bang, and we worked around the clock for about a month before taking a break. A few of us took vacations with our families and on our return two weeks later, we found the community still ready for more. We made a decision to move forward with the project in earnest that day, and to remember those who were present and helping, we created the footclan role. Footclan, like ninja is a role that is just a color, and has no functional role advantages on the server.

The exalted pink names. Rumor has it they control the media.

Developer is the first of the roles we’ll discuss that can be attained by anybody, and has some merit attached to it. The one requirement to be a developer is to have code you contributed merged into our repositories. Typos don’t count necessarily but if you submit a patch or a fix for something, or if you maintain your own project in our GitHub organization, you get the hot pink Developer role. This role has functions on the server such as managing messages and access to dev-bridge feeds to IRC for other organizations (IPFS, Monero, currently). A good way to get this role is to check out our [Good First Issues](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which are easy, low hanging fruit objectives.

Do you have a liberal arts degree? We’ve got a job for you!

Some folks want to help with stuff like writing guides, fixing typos, creating branding material. We needed a way to acknowledge people who share non-code contributions with us, and this seemed like a good way to do it. Obviously this one is pretty easy to attain, so to maintain some degree of exclusivity, we require that you register an account and Pull Request your contribution yourself. We’ll help, we just want you to be a well-rounded contributor, otherwise we’d have to give this role to every pedant who points out a spelling error, and that’s no fun!

Nobody knows about this role

Core contributor is a Developer who has had code merged into our core software. If you complete a Good First Issue on the core repo, you’ll get Core Contributor and Developer all in one shot. Nobody really asks for this role so we just apply it to people we know have contributed code to the core software as we notice them. No clue why. Also just a color role.

These are the music makers

Service Operator is a role given to people who operate public nodes, pools, web-wallets, tipbot, exchange, and any other application that integrates with our daemon and has an interest in knowing when things are screwy on the network. This role came out of a need of a way to address all of our service providers when we had patch fixes, network advisories, or critical consensus updates. This role gives you access to a private water-cooler type room that gets used about once a month when a large service optimizes their wallets and fills the TX pool with 1000 fusion transactions.

This role is cursed

PR Guerilla originally was a role we gave to people who made heroic acts of recruitment. The first person to get this role, GT3000, recruited over 500 people in a single week. These were active users that flooded the chat due to his efforts, many of them stayed and became contributors. This role is cursed, however, because every person who’s ever achieved it has disappeared immediately after.

Guest Dev is the title for well known core developers of other well known networks. This role was created so TRTL Developers can easily identify core contributors from other well known networks and talk shop with them. If you’re from a TRTL sized network and you’re reasonably active in our chat, you probably already have this role.

Educators have written classes or course materials for the TurtleEDU platform. What’s TurtleEDU you ask? It’s an e-learning platform we made to turn crypto-newbies into knowledgeable users, and take curious knowledgeable users and turn them into contributing developers. If you’d like to be an educator, we’d currently love to have someone write a course on interacting with REST API’s via a class on interacting with Wallet-API. (hint hint, aspiring educators!)

PSSST! Hey kid, you wanna buy a Nintendo? \*opens coat\*

These guys are basically moderators of the #Merchandise channel in Discord, where anybody can list an item when the bot is working that describes an item and a price in TRTL to sell it for. We’ve got a weekly column for this in the weekly roundup. Technically one could gain this role, but with the new merchandise bot it may be useless as the bot handles most of this stuff. This role came from an era when the merchandise channel was just for posting a single listing per line and not using it as a conversational channel. As things go, nobody, and I mean none of you fuckers can follow a single damn rule and it quickly devolved into conversations so we just opened it up and told people to pin their listings instead. When it works, the merchandise bot is a great thing to have.

Crash Test Turtles

This is a fearless brigade of self-appointed masochists who test all of our software before it is released. To give yourself this role, and a spiffy yellow name, type `*tester` in the chat and you'll receive pings when we need testers for new software releases. [This is what the report that testers fill out looks like \[link\]](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/864)

To gain access to the EDU chat channels, type `*student` in the chat. This is for people who are in the [TurtleEDU program](http://edu.turtlecoin.lol/) that wish to receive updates about it. The TurtleEDU program is an e-learning platform we created to help people who are new to cryptoasset networks get more acquainted with their surroundings.

Datacenter nerds are the most socially disjointed kind of nerd you’ll ever meet.

These are people who can add and approve and delete or revoke records to the TRTL DNS system. If you’ve ever seen someone with a .trtl domain name, someone with the DNS role approved it. If you want to know more about .trtl domains, [check this article out.](https://dns.turtlecoin.lol/)

Stay away from these people.

We have a disciplinary area called Exile, and if you’ve seen someone with this role, they’re probably in Exile, with a jumpsuit on as evidenced by their name probably being something like `Inmate #558929`. These are people who you will have to walk down to #exile in the chat to speak to, because although they can read, they cannot reply anywhere else. You can shout at the inmates through the intercom by typing `@exiled` and whatever your message is. This role has so few privileges, you're basically in timeout and only people who love you can come see you.

FNG’s

We use a bot some of you know that applies levels and points when people are active in chat. We use it to help identify new or inactive people to get you involved in the community. When you first enter the chat, you’re an Egg. When you’ve said hello or anything really, you become a hatchling. If you stick around even longer after that your name will turn green and you become a Turtle. After that, sky’s the limit, some say there are level upgrades all the way to 100…

These people want to know everything as it happens.

News is a self applied role you can get by typing `*news` in the chat. This will give you an alert every Tuesday when we post the weekly roundup. This role was Farhod's idea, who wanted a better way to know when we've posted the weekly update.

You shouldn’t want this role.

We label a certain type of user as ‘spoonfed’, and though it could happen for various reasons, functionally it means you cannot post in dev-general, and it flags you as someone who’s likely to pester helpful devs. If you have this role, you should feel shame. People who get this role typically pop in our chats asking a seemingly basic question, then when someone helpful assists them, they latch onto your leg and won’t leave you the fuck alone because they don’t have any interest in learning anything, they just want someone to do it for them. Helping these types doesn’t help them, and it doesn’t help you, and it aids in all of our own abuse. If these people annoy you, stop hitting yourself. You’ll quickly notice every person with this role has a half-broken TRTL-forked shitcoin network that they’re eagerly waiting to dump on unsuspecting miners as soon as it hits market.

This is a role that we just added recently, it has something to do with basically being a moderator for our karaoke bot, Grandmaster Riddim Bot. Not sure what it does exactly as a role, but the bot required it to acknowledge admin commands or something.
