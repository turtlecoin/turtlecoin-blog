This has nothing to do with TRTL but we needed a catchy header image and the beers are saying this is the one.

This week depending who we asked, you either got cooked alive in your apartment or floated away in the rain, nevertheless we still got work done :D here is this week’s update!

**Proton v0.0.9-beta Release!**

What’s up TurtleCoin? Thanks very much for everybody that helped out beta testing the new wallet. If you’re not currently testing it out, now is a great time as we just dropped version 0.0.12, the first non-beta release! Since the last post, we’ve added alot of improvements and features, as well as mac support for a truly cross-platform desktop wallet. You can grab the latest version at the Releases link below.

Chukwa’s Labyrinth

**Chukwa’s Labyrinth**

Hey! So I’ve been working on my first game for the past few weeks. I think I mentioned it last week in the roundup. It’s finally ready to play! In the game, you have to go through a series of mazes in order to reach the treasure at the end. So far there are only two levels, but there are instructions and plenty of stuff in them! Play it and let me know how it is, ping me in #dev_gaming with any comments or advice! You can download it from the link given below

## Good First Issues

Good First Issues are tickets that are marked as ‘easy wins’ for new developers. If you want to be a TurtleCoin Developer, these are great tasks to start with!

**Daemon+WalletBackend timestamp adjustments**  
The current /getwalletsyncdata rounds a timestamp to midnight. Depending on what time of the day you start a fresh wallet, you may have no blocks to grab (we need to roll back a bit more than we currently do with the timestamp adjustment), or too many (since it’s rounding to midnight which is quite far away).  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/704>

**Remove no longer relevant asserts**  
Since pretty much everyone runs the daemon in release mode, instead of debug mode, we’ve ended up where we have a number of asserts which constantly trigger, due to altered/moved/rewritten sections of code.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/811>

**QueryBlocksDetailed does not populate transaction extra “raw” property in response**  
`.transactions[i].extra.raw` is not populated in the code as it should be.
