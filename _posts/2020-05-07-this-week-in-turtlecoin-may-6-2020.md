## Developer Updates

This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL proj*ect they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community.*

## trtl-py

trtl-py is a Python Wrapper for the JSON RPC interface of TurtleCoind and Wallet-API. It has recently been updated and version 0.0.2 has been pushed to PyPI. Now, you cab specify a timeout for connection to the host while instantiating the class (default is 5). Also, there a brand new Utils class which has many functions to ease your life while making an application. I hope you’ll like the updates. :-)

## Karai Wiki

We were beginning to accumulate a lot of “here’s how X works” in the chat, and I didn’t want to let those bits of information to get buried. Wanting to try out the wiki feature of Github for its simplicity, I took the notes on the schema for the different transaction type construction methods and wrote explainers for each field which made a few different documents describing how Karai transactions are constructed. It was surprisingly easy to get the content up with just a little bit of markdown.

If you’d like to check it out, I’ve included descriptions of the [root transaction](https://github.com/turtlecoin/go-karai/wiki/Root-Tx-Characteristics), [milestone transactions,](https://github.com/turtlecoin/go-karai/wiki/Milestone-Tx-Characteristics) [subgraph-tip transactions](https://github.com/turtlecoin/go-karai/wiki/Subgraph-Tip-Tx-Characteristics), and [normal transactions](https://github.com/turtlecoin/go-karai/wiki/Standard-Tx-Characteristics).

## TurtleEDU Is Getting A New Class!

It’s probably not as exciting as some of you may think, but a question that comes up a lot when a new developer is making a project. “What should my license be for this thing?”. IBMCD and I are working on a class to explain all of the open source licenses and turn you into a licensing ninja for your next project. Stay tuned!

This week’s miner of the week is **Greywolf!**

**About this rig:** rig2 was the second rig i put together, probably around early summer of 2018\. it sets inside a Crappyrules Ⓤ approved frame, made of 1/2 inch aluminum angle bar and self-tapping screws. there are wood slats on the bottom that support the power supply and the motherboard, which is propped up by standoffs. the motherboard is a GIGABYTE GA-AX370-Gaming, with 2 full sized pci-e slots (a x16 and a x4), and 8GB of RAM. an on/off button and a normal cheap $2 pc speaker are plugged into the mainboard. i like to hear the beep as it boots; plus on rare occasions when Windows reboots ignoring my settings, i can hear it from the other room, and am able to restart my miners faster. the on/off switch is because i don’t have the balls to repeatedly use a screwdriver across 2 pins on the motherboard. the cpu is an AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 8 core (16 threads). there are two gpu’s, both NVIDIA GTX 1070\. card-mounted fans that are the width of 1/2 a slot are next to each gpu. a 3 foot usb 3.0 cable runs from the rear to the front, for easy usb access on the rare occassion it’s needed. the power supply is an EVGA 600B 600W.

**Hashrate**: 12500 H/s on windows ninjarig
