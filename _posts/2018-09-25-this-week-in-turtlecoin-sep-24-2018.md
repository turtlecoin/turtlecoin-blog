_Dear TRTL Community,_

_This week, you’ve all been extra awesome, and made some of your biggest moves yet. We just want to say that every day you guys amaze us and put the smiles on our faces and wind in our sails to keep pushing this project forward. Keep up the momentum, and keep being the example to others for_ [_what a Good Turtle should be_](http://blog.turtlecoin.lol/@turtlecoin/how-to-be-a-good-turtle-20a427028a18)_! You guys rock!_

# Developer Updates

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/0aEKGWM62VoeYQXQm.png)

**Local Turtle Block Explorer** — After the previous post, I have redesign the layout of this project. At this point, you can run the local turtle explorer on your windows PC by just double clicking it. The daemon is running in the mode that other users can connect; in the future I am planning to add an option to choose to start the daemon in different mode. I would like to encourage everyone to run the local explorer on your machine as it helps the turtle network grow. I am also planning to combine the trtl wallet with this project. If anyone is interested in collaborating on this project, feel free to contact me on discord. **— Sabo (Revolutionary)**

**New TurtleCoin Forking Guide!** — In an effort to help people better use and understand our code base, I teamed up with Zpalmtree to create a great forking guide for you guys that we hope is as [easy as the one the Ethereum guys have.](https://ethereum.org/token)

Forking TurtleCoin and expanding on the code base gets more developers looking at and building on our code. A common misconception is that it takes something away from the TurtleCoin project, but quite the opposite; several projects, Plenteum and Amity have both contributed back to the TRTL Project with work they originally did for their own coins. This is the spirit of open source, and we love giving the same open door to others that were shown to us when we first got started. Check out the new forking guide at the link below and take a chance at making something great! **— Rock**

**Web Wallet —** Busy applying changes to masari’s webwallet so it will work for Turtle. This includes, a project restructure to dotnet core (done), re-write of the background caching process to handle large chains (done), re-work of the client side crypto functions to work for TurtleCoin (done), re-brand for turtle and a few other minor things. Am currently working on some improvements to how mempool Tx’s are handled in the web wallet and am adding some additional info to be displayed if there are unconfirmed fusion transactions. **— WhassupZA (Discord), Dave (GitHub)**

**Nest —** Version 0.34 of Nest, your GUI wallet, was released this week. It has been intensively tested, so you will not encounter the issues we had in 0.32\. Please upgrade as it uses latest core 0.8.3, which is not compatible with previous versions. I think you will like the new address directory and wallet scan height features. If you are the maintainer of a fork of TurtleCoin, I made a guide to fork Nest for your coin: <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-go/blob/master/docs/forking-nest.md> **— Jon — Nest**
