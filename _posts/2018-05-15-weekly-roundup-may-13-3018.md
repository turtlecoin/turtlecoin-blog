Ryan’s Turtle Racing Steals the Show!

- **Ryan’s Turtle Racing —** _“Hello, quick check in on Turtle Coin Racing. I recently added and am testing Show and Place bets (betting for 2nd and 3rd place in the race), it has three environments now with two lengths to each course, and a ball dropping mini-game between races to earn points. Still a bit embarrassed to release the code (amateur programming and personal stuff is hard coded) so short term goals are cleaning it up and then opening sourcing the code. I don’t want to run betting with real TRTL personally as it’d be gambling (but if someone wants to add that go for it it shouldn’t be hard), I think it is a fun game in its own right that promotes TurtleCoin in theme and with prizes, with an executable distributed for streamers to host their own races eventually”_

Amptile shows support for the TRTL community with a really cool printed tee and laminated info cards for the local community! Great work Amptile!

- **Amptile’s community outreach project — _“_**_well, everyone talks about how much they love the community and I just thought, why not help expand it. It’s been stated months ago that we want turtles value to be an organic growth and what better way than to leave quick tidbits of info laying around the physical world and not just online. We can leave these at typical hang outs for younger people who are more incline to enter the world of crypto.”_ **— amptile**

EncryptedUnicorn’s One Click Miner

- **One-Click-Miner —**_“ After my final exams, I’m still alive and back for my turtle friends! And I even found time to continue my work on the upcoming release of the one click miner. You can already see some changes in the screenshot including the support for multiple miners coming with the new algorithm as well as more pool selection options. Coding is nearly done and after some finishing touches and when everything hopefully goes well, I’ll upload the sources and release a new version during the next days. Thanks for being so patient! Much love to you all ❤”_ **— EncryptedUnicorn**
